# Gobbler_assign
Simple area game for a class of seven year olds to play. It requires the play to avoid bad sprites while still collecting the good sprites. There will be three different levels each level having more bad sprites to avoid and more good sprites needed to collect in  order to win level. The player will have a three lives for each level in case they intersect with a bad sprite they will be available to continue with the game. The game will boot up with a start screen and three buttons with different titles on them. One button will take the user to an instruction screen with how to play and an image of the good and bad sprites, another will display a level select screen with the three level displayed, the last one will start the game at level one and allow the players to continue to go up levels. Each of the screens will have a back button incase the user misclicked and didn't mean to click the button.
